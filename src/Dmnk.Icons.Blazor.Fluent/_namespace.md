Provide icon definitions using <xref:Dmnk.Icons.Core> for the Fluent design system, or more specifically, the
[Blazor Fluent UI components](https://www.fluentui-blazor.net/Icon). Since this library is based off of a
Blazor component library, it only works in Blazor applications. In theory, it could be refactored using code-generation
to pull icons from the [official main repo for Fluent icons](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons/).
