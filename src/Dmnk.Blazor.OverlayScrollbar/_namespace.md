uid: Dmnk.Blazor.OverlayScrollbar

This library provides a Blazor component that wraps the
[OverlayScrollbars.js](https://kingsora.github.io/OverlayScrollbars/) library to provide some nicer
scrollbars for Blazor applications. See the documentation of the
[component](xref:Dmnk.Blazor.OverlayScrollbar.OverlayScrollbar) for details.

It is currently not possible to customize the behavior and appearance at all. Only the default
configuration is used. (Contributions welcome.)
